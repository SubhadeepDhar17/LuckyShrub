<h1>This is the project assignment from Meta's Front End Course, <br> Course 3: HTML and CSS in depth</h1>

<h5>The project here is a little bit more advancved with added '@media' queires to make the website responsive for different viewport.</h5>
I hope you find this useful.

I will keep editing and adding all other respective pages and eventually add JS to make it responsive.
